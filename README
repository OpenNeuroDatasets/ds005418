# Cerebrovascular Reactivity: CO2 inhalation and resting state comparisons

## Description

Thirty-six healthy adult subjects with no prior history of neurological or psychiatric disorder were included in this dataset.

The goal is to compare CVR computed using breathing challenges (CO2-inhalation) to relative-CVR obtained from resting-state data only.

A subset of this dataset is also a subset of https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004604

## Rawdata

- Anatomical data: a standard T1w image was acquired for each subject.
- Functional data: each subject underwent an fMRI scan with blocs of CO2 inhalation challenges as well as a six-minutes resting state session.
- Physiological data: breath CO2 was recorded using a capnograph during the fMRI acquisition for the CO2 inhalation task.
